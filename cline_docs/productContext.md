# Product Context

## Project Purpose
Logify is a lightweight and efficient logging system designed to simplify tracking and debugging. The system provides real-time log management, customizable output formats, and seamless integration capabilities.

## Core Problems Solved
1. Centralized Log Management
   - Single source of truth for application logs
   - Consistent log format and structure
   - Easy access and retrieval

2. Debug Efficiency
   - Real-time log monitoring
   - Structured error tracking
   - Context-rich log entries

3. Application Integration
   - Simple API integration
   - Standardized response formats
   - Secure authentication system

## Key Workflows

### 1. Authentication Flow
```
User ─→ Login/Register ─→ Session Created ─→ Protected Routes Available
         │                     │
         │                     ↓
         │               Redis Session Store
         ↓
    Validation & Auth
```

### 2. Logging Flow (Planned)
```
Application ─→ Log Entry Creation ─→ Processing & Storage ─→ Query & Analysis
                    │                       │                      │
                    ↓                       ↓                      ↓
             Input Validation         Data Enrichment        Search & Filter
```

## Product Priorities

### Current Phase (Authentication & Response Format)
1. ✅ Secure user authentication
2. ✅ Session management
3. ✅ Standardized API responses
4. ✅ Response format documentation

### Next Phase (Logging System)
1. Log entry creation and storage
2. Log querying and filtering
3. Real-time log monitoring
4. Log analytics and reporting

## Integration Guidelines
1. Authentication:
   - Session-based authentication
   - Protected routes require valid session
   - Redis for session storage

2. API Response Format:
   - Consistent success/error formats
   - Standard HTTP status codes
   - Detailed error information
   - Request path and timestamp included

3. Response Examples:
```json
// Success Response
{
  "success": true,
  "statusCode": 200,
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "data": {
    // Response data
  },
  "timestamp": "ISO date",
  "path": "/endpoint"
}

// Error Response
{
  "success": false,
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Error message",
  "error": {
    "code": "ErrorType",
    "details": {}
  },
  "timestamp": "ISO date",
  "path": "/endpoint"
}
```

## Future Enhancements
1. Advanced log analytics
2. Custom dashboard creation
3. Alert system integration
4. Export and reporting features
